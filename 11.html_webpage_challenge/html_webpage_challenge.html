        <h2>Knights</h2>

           <p>A knight is a person granted an honorary title of knighthood by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors called the cavalry. Usually soldiers that were commanded by these knights were called Men-at-arms.
