<h2><center>Comments about Butter Chicken</center></h2>
<p>This appetizing and tasty meal was first created India during the time of the Mughal Empire. Butter chicken came about by accident. It was created by the cooks at a famous restaurant called the Moti Mahal.</P>
<p>The cooks then took the sauce and tossed it around with tandoor chicken pieces. The mixture that they created became known as Butter Chicken.</p>
<p>So this means that butter chicken was never intentially made but was actually made by mistake from recycled chicken stock and pieces</p>

<p><h3><center>What I learnt</center></h3></p>
<ul>
  <li>The things I learnt from this recipe is that cooking needs to be precise or your dish will flop or fail.
    <li>Another thing is that we need to cook with passion or there will be no love in the food and it will taste bland.
