    <p><h1><Center>Sorry, Silicon Valley Won’t Save Your Kids From Tech Addiction</center></h1></p>
<p>“I am tethered to my smartphone for both work and entertainment, as is my husband. It’s omnipresent and an extension of our bodies. Not wanting to be left out, my 16-month-old son takes the baby monitor, holds it in his hands, and peers at it like it is a smartphone. It is the cutest/most pathetic thing.” These are the words of a mother worried that her children are Tech addicts</p>
<p>In November, Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist who was an early employee at <strong>Facebook</strong>, said that the social network was “ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.” Tristan Harris, a former product manager at <strong>Google</strong>, told Wired that <strong>Apple, Google, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram</strong> design products to “<em>hijack</em>” our time and attention. In January, two <strong>Apple</strong> investors asked the company to study the <em>health effects</em> of its products on children. That the very people who championed the technology to which we are addicted are now banding together to warn parents about the monster they’ve created is perhaps a sign that more people are starting to question tech’s outsized role in our lives. But it feels a bit farfetched that an ad campaign, no matter how well-intentioned, can really help curtail our society’s addiction–especially when kids these days are being introduced to screens at such a young age. To find out what parents think about their kids’ use of tech, Fast Company surveyed nearly 400 parents. We tried to look at the issue from all angles, from the amount of screen time kids get to have, to the types of devices kids use, to parents’ regrets about their kids use of technology, to the benefits that technology can provide to families. We also asked parents how they feel about witnessing their own tech addiction reflected in their kids’ behavior. Those were, perhaps, the most telling answers of all. The parents who answered our survey hail from all over the U.S. (and a few other countries). Their professions span many industries, including marketing, public relations, education, finance, therapy, video production, law, medicine, and business. Most participants have one or two children, ranging from 7 months to 18 years old. The majority of participants’ kids are between 3 and 11 years old; in other words, these parents are in the thick of parenting. </p>

<p><h2>DO SCREENS MAKE KIDS LESS SOCIAL AND LESS CREATIVE?</h2></p>
<p>Even if it involves lots of virtual interaction via social networks and texting, using a screen can be a pretty solo activity. Using smartphones, tablets, and even computers aren’t generally as communal as watching a TV with your family. TV has been around a long time. For many of us, it is the devil we know and, unlike other screened devices, it’s arguably easier for parents to know what their children are watching on TV than it is for parents to know what their kids are looking at on the internet. In fact, as crazy as it might sound, we’ve reached a point where some parents actually wish their kids were watching more TV.</p>

<p><h3>BEING A ROLE MODEL IS SCARY</h3></p>
<p>A lot of parenting can be a battle of “do what I say, not what I do”–and nowhere is this more evident than in parents’ use of tech. Many parents in our survey said their device dependency makes them feel like hypocrites when they try to limit their kids’ tech use. “My main regret is how much we use phones in front of them,” wrote a mom of two from Minnesota who doesn’t allow any screen time for her two young children.

Many parents who answered our survey said that having kids forced them to look more critically at how they use technology and caused these parents to make a conscious effort to change.</p>

<p><h4>PARENTS ARE WORRIED ABOUT ADDICTION</h4></p>
<p>With a lack of solid national data on the effects of all this tech exposure on kids, parents definitely have a lot of concerns. In our unscientific survey, only a blissed out 1% of parents expressed no concerns about their kids’ use of tech. For the rest of our participants, nearly everyone (over 80%) communicated concern about their kids becoming addicted and developing a shortened attention span (likely because the parents are experiencing these problems themselves). In our survey, addiction appears to trump the traditional things we were told to fear on the internet, like sexual predators and online bullying, which only concerned about half of parents who took part in our survey. And data privacy is only a concern for a little more than half of parents who took part in our questionnaire. These parents’ concerns are backed up by research. A 2016 survey from Common Sense Media found that 78% of teenagers check their devices at least hourly, and half said that they thought they were addicted to their phones. There is a lot of debate, however, over whether it is possible to truly be addicted, in the clinical sense, to technology.</p>

<p><h4>WHAT ABOUT SCHOOL?</h4></p>
<p>A constant refrain in our survey was how the near total saturation of tech in schools made the entire idea of “screen time” much more nebulous. After all, many schools (especially in more affluent districts) have introduced a one-to-one program for kids with tablets or Chromebooks, some starting in elementary school. Kids actually learn better in classrooms where two or three kids have to share each device because that forces them to collaborate.But regardless of kids’ use of tech in the classroom, nearly all kids are required to check or complete their homework online, which means that they will spend some of their time at home online. Several parents in our survey feel like this means that putting limits on screen time is out of their hands.  Homayoun delivers school orientation programs to teach parents, teachers, and students how to self-regulate and stay motivated. She believes that setting limits on how long kids can be on devices, even if they are using them to do homework.</p>

<p><h3>PARENTAL CONTROL</h3></p>
<p>Most of the parents who answered our survey don’t use parental controls on all the devices that their kids use. Sometimes this led to frightening results, as one parent wrote: “I wish I was more ahead of the game on knowing how to block certain sites. My sweet innocent daughter was accidentally exposed to soft-core porn when looking for Barbie princess videos online.” Parents might be skipping out of the parental controls because they don’t trust them. As Homayoun points out, “Kids are smart and can find ways around them.” She advises that rather than blocking or banning certain sites or apps, parents should work to understand what their kids are using and have a conversation with their children about their goals in visiting the sites.</p>

<p><h3>REALISTIC LIMITS AND EXPECTATIONS</h3></p>
<P>If there is one overarching theme to our survey and all of the current research around kids’ use of tech, it’s this: We still don’t know. That’s really the bottom line to this thorny conversation. Technology has changed so rapidly in just the last 15 years, let alone since the time today’s parents were kids themselves. Screen time often feels like the new sugar: We fear it’s rotting our kids’ insides. And while it’s true that we need more research to really understand how screen time is affecting kids’ brains. Like most things in life, the solution might just be moderation. It may seem like we are at a point of no return, but some families are finding their way back, And like any other behavior parents hope to impress on their kids (manners, healthy eating habits, volunteering), parents’ actions make a much bigger impact than their words.</p>

  <p><h3>THE UPSIDE</h3></p>
  <p>Of course, not all tech use falls into the mindless games and social media camp. As many parents pointed out, aptitude with technology is a crucial skill for kids to succeed in school and in later careers.

To that end, some of the parents helped get their kids excited about being engaged with tech by sharing what they were doing when they were staring at a screen. The bulk of the conversations around kids and tech is about the dangers of addiction, shortened attention spans, privacy, online bullying, depression, and lack of empathy. But the saturation of technology in kids’ lives is helping them in ways that weren’t possible a generation ago. I’m at the beginning of my parenting life. My son isn’t even 2 years old. Who knows what tech we’ll be worried about by the time he’s in high school, or what his concerns will be when he becomes a parent. Like the parents in our survey, my plan is to give him the tools he’ll need to succeed, and teach him the best way to use them. And for now, I make sure that I save my email checking for after he goes to bed.</p>
