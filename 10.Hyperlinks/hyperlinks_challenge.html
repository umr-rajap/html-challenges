    <p>So what have i learnt this far? I've learnt that coding requires your fully attention on a regular bases actually 24/7. Coding is not easy at all but its not difficult as well its all about how much effort you put in and this will decide the level of difficulty coding will be for you. I've learnt all about html and how to implement it into a text editor like the Atom app. HTML is like the infrastructure of a house without it your coding will collapse. While learning i was taught different types of HTML tags, elements and atrributes. These are used constantly when coding and some tags have changed over time.</p>
<p></p>
    <p>If you want to dive into Web Development then learning HTML is first necessary step. HTML is easy to learn within few days if you remain focused and dedicate your time properly. There are plenty of resources over internet where you can start learning HTML.The basics of HTML are easy to learn but if you want to go in depth, then it will take a bit longer. HTML5 is pretty vast topic which includes many advance topics that previous versions lacked. For a beginner, I suggest to refer W3Schools Online Web Tutorials HTML course which is very good. Once you develop better understanding of basics of HTML. Although HTML editors are supposed to do the necessary HTML coding, you have to remember that that they are not perfect and can make mistakes. This is the main reason why you have to learn HTML. You have to make adjustments when the HTML editors put in unnecessary codes and do your own HTML coding in case they crash. </p>

    <p>I would say that its going okay for me i do hit a few bumps in my path and i would sit on a certain HTML for literally 40 minutes and finally seeing that i made a simple mistake like forgetting a sign like < or /. One thing i would want to do as a coder is to work on my own in seclusion</p>
